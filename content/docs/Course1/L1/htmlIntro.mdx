        <ShadcnComponents.HoverCard.HoverCardContent className="text-sm min-w-[30vw]">``Example``: _This Popup_ <br/><br/> ``Defintion``: "A user interface, UI is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur."  <br/><br/> <Link className="linkElement text-xs " href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"}>(Wikipedia contributors.
