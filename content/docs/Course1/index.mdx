## Introduction

This course is designed to teach the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and should prepare you to dive even deeper in the world of Web-Development. [Course 2](/docs/Course2) Is designed for programmers who already know the basics and have a solid understanding of JavaScript.

## Who am I?

_(And before someone comments that any of this info shouldn't be on here, it's fine it's already collected online anyways, and I'd rather those who want to know me have an opportunity to do so.)_

### Basic Info:

I'm completely self-taught, and I've learned most of my knowledge from programming documentation, trial and error, and my past colleagues.

- My name: `Quincy M. Dack`,
- My programming aliases are: `SomeProgrammer` or `SomePogProgrammer` <span className="inline-flex align-middle"> <a href="https://github.com/SomePogProgrammer" className="hover:text-blue-500"><GitHubLogoIcon className="shrink-0 w-[2vw] h-[3vh]" /></a> </span>
- From: Minneapolis, MN. (I currently live in North Carolina)
- Current status: (Self-Taught Full-Stack Web Developer)

### Interests/Hobbies:

    - Programming (Developmental programming, like Software, Web, Hardware, and Games)
    - Pretty much anything IT
    - Teaching
    - Learning new things
    - Volunteering
    - Hardware & Computers
    - Ice-Hockey (NHL and some local/college teams)
    - Casual american football enjoyer too, mainly College Level

### More on who I am:

I'm very religious (Christian, non denominational <span className="inline-flex align-middle"><FaCross className="shrink-0 w-[2vw] h-[3vh]" /> </span>), but I respect everyone and their beliefs. I enjoy teaching and learning things from others, and I'm really passionate about Programming and technology in general. I'm self-taught, and I've learned so much about myself through teaching both others and myself. I've come to realize that:

> There is no such thing as being smarter, rather it's about how one utilizes and understands their mind.

- _Quincy M. Dack_

I also work (volunteer) part-time on the AV (Audio/Video) team at my Church, and I hope to get more into IT. My plan is to get into [`The University Of North Carolina: Chapel Hill`](https://www.unc.edu).
And I owe all my talents, and my acomplishments to the LORD, who has gifted me so much. I'm definitely not perfect, but I do my best to improve myself, I'm trying to improve my public speaking and social perspective every day. I've came a long way, I wouldn't say I'm introverted nor overly extroverted.

#### The Vision

My vision, (though It's really the LORD's not mine), is to start a Programming school, where I teach programming and other closely related things, while also doing ministry through a program in that programming school. Offering a lower cost, and hopefully eventually free way to learn the future to students and anyone interested in learning.

### Programming Background

I started programming when I was _11 years old_, my first programming language was `Lua` in the form of `LuaU` on Roblox, where I did game development for around 3 years full time, and another year part time. I've sinced mastered the language, and it holds a big place in my heart. And it also started my grudge against Python, Lol.

{" "}

<ins>As of *Nov. 2024*</ins>:

I have 5+ Years of Programming experience. (3-4+ Years in game development, and 2+ in Web Development )

The languages I know (By know, I mean I'm fully capable of programming in, and I'm able to use them to a high degree). (These include frameworks and some aren't 'true' programming languages.)

I also know a bit of: Python, C#, and Rust (Enough to maybe fix small bugs and syntax errors, I basically only know their syntax)
