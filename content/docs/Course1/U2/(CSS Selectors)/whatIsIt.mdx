        <span className="text-muted-foreground">*So what actually is a CSS selector?*</span>&nbsp; Well, like a lot of things in CSS they are quite simple.

        A selector does one simple thing:

        - Selects, or 'defines' what is supposed to be styled.
        

        In order to start styling elements, you first need to tell CSS **what** exactly you want to have styled.
        And to do this, all you have to do is use a CSS selector. Selectors basically point to places in the DOM (HTML).

        There are different types of selectors, I'll go into depth with them (in the following lesson), but their concept is very simple.
