## HTML Attributes/Properties

Before we can start learning how to use new HTML tags, we need to understand what an HTML attribute is.

HTML attributes (I'm going to refer to them as properties, in HTML it's interchangable). Properties allow you to pass information to a HTML tag. Each HTML tag uses properties differently; however they share a lot in common. 

## Syntax for an Attribute

It's really simple. Inside of the **First** tag, or openning HTML tag, of an element, you can set the value of an element's properties. 
Here's an example. Using the element: `p` (This stands for paragraph, aka just text.), the property/attribute: `name`

```html
<p name="myname"></p>
```
Properties can be set by simply, typing their name, and then adding an equal sign `=`, followed by the value. In this case, the value is a string (text), so I used double quotes: "",
What you use to set the property depends on what the value is. For strings you can use:
- Double quotes `""`
- Single quote `''`
- Or, a backtick <code>&#96;</code>

*There are other value types too. Like an array  `[]`, Or Object `{}`. However you don't need to understand or know this currently.*

Just understand, that to set an attribute to a text (string) value, you can use any of these: `""`, `''`, <code>&#96;</code>

    <DocComponents.Accordion.Accordion title="Why are there 3 ways to express a string?">
        Great Question!

        Because of something called: 'An escape character'. 
        Essentially, characters that are pared together to represent either a type, or beginning/end, have escape rules.
        
        Escaping, means ending, an escape character allows for something to end. 
        These 'pared' characters, like `''{:js}`, `""{:js}`, <code>&#96;</code>, `{}{:js}`, `[]{:js}`, `>{:html}`,`< {:html}` can be 'escaped' by either their corresponding (opposite) character, ex: `" and "{:js}`, `{ and }{:js}`, **or** they can be escaped by an escape character.
        
        Some escape characters:
        - Forward slash `/{:js}`
        - Backslash `\{:js}`
        (There's also something called, escape sequences too.)

        What that means is:
        If I have a string, that uses single quotes:

## Attribute Categories
I'm going to split up the properties into a few categories so we can group them, this will help us understand what a majority of them do.

<DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="info">**This doesn't cover all HTML properties**, take this with a grain of salt. This is to help organize them to better allow you to understand what they do.</DocComponents.Callout.Callout>

*Different elements have different properties, they will not always be the same.*
<>
* ### Identifiers
    * **Includes** properties like:
        * `id` - (Identifier/Identification) is referenced by doing: `#[id]`
        * `class` - The class or classes associated with the element. Reference by doing: `.[classname]`
        * `name` - The name of the element.
        * `key` - Used to uniquely identify elements in a table/list.
        * `element name (TagName)` (This is inferred from the tag of the element)

**Identifiers** are used to, like it sounds, identify an specific element or elements.
* ### Events & States
    * **Includes** properties like:
        * `onClick` - An event that fires when an element is clicked
        * `onFocus` - An event that fires when an element is focused on (click, drag, etc)
        * `onChange` - An event that fires when an element or its properties change.
        * `onHover` - An event that fires when an element is hoverred over by a mouse.
        * any/most things with 'on' - Represents an event
        * anything that starts with `data-` - Represents a property associated with a function/event.

**Events & States** are functions, or information associated with interactions that occur with the element. (This will be elaborated more on the JS unit.)
* ### Properties
    *  **Includes** properties like:
        * `style` - Used to style a element with CSS.
        * `children`- Refers to the elements underneath (Elements inbetween the element's opening and closing tag `<element name="hi">(children)</element>{:html}`)
        * `href` - (Hypertext Reference), aka a link or directory. Ex: https://google.com or ./myDirectory
        * `src` - (Source), essentially the same thing as href, though it is for certain elements. Ex: https://google.com or ./myDirectory 
        * `type` - Sometimes different depending on the element, but it typically represents a varient or type of the element.
        * etc - Most HTML properties all under this category.

**Properties** are used for a wide variety of different things, each one is typically different.
