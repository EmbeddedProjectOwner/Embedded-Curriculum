## What Is ``HTML``? <span className="inline-flex align-middle"><IoLogoHtml5 className="mdx_Icon" /></span> [#what-is-it]

<span className="text-muted-foreground">_Hypertext Markup Language_</span> (HTML), is often referred to as a 'programming language', however it isn't actually one. In reality, it's a extension of markup. 
If none of that made sense that's fine, here's a explanation of what HTML actually is:

<>HTML is a language that allows for a person to create <HoverCardInline Props={{Content: {className: "text-sm min-w-[30vw]"}}} Trigger={"UI"}>
``Example``: _This Popup_ <br/><br/> ``Defintion``: "A user interface, UI is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur."  <br/><br/> <Link className="linkElement text-xs " href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"}>(Wikipedia contributors. "User interface." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 26 Dec. 2024. Web. 29 Dec. 2024.)</Link>
</HoverCardInline> (User interface, which is almost everything on a computer screen)</> 

<>
    HTML, is the base of almost every single website on the internet. Ever opened up Inspect element, and wondered, *what am I looking at?*
    **Simple**: You're looking at HTML.
</> 
<> 

 ## Syntax 
 <>HTML has very a basic <HoverCardInline Trigger={"syntax"} Content={'Definition: Syntax, a way a language is written or interpretted.'}></HoverCardInline> ``(Syntax: A way that a language is written or spoken/interpreted)`` and it works with CSS and JavaScript.</>

    In HTML you can use an opening an closing tag (``<>{:html}``) and a HTML tag name (``<tagname>{:html}``) to represent UI.
    ```html
        <> <!-- A Opening Tag -->
        </> <!-- A Closing Tag -->
    ```
    Example:

    
 

    ```html title="example.html"
    <tagname></tagname>
    ```
    These tagnames represent an element (Element: An HTML tag) in UI.
</>
<DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="warn" title="Important to Note!">It is best practice, and **HIGHLY** recommended to end all elements with a closing tag.  <br/><br/> *Elements may work without a closing tag*; however, a lot of technologies/frameworks that you'll learn later on will require a closing tag. (There are a few exceptions, ex: `<!DOCTYPE>{:html}`)</DocComponents.Callout.Callout>

### Quick Rules

<DocComponents.Steps.Steps>
   <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
   ##### **Closing Tags**
        Elements should **always** have a closing tag.
        Because: <span className="text-muted-foreground">*Tags show where an element begins and ends. If an element does not have a closing tag, the interpreter may think that all following elements are inside that element.*</span>
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    ##### **Comments**
        To make a comment in HTML (Text that doesn't get compiled), use an unclosed tag starting with: `<!--` `your comment` and `-->` to end the commend.
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">_Example:_</span> 
        ```html 
        <!-- my comment -->
        ```
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>

    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    ##### **HTML Documents**
        <> An HTML file is referred to as a Document: <> Also referred to as <HoverCardInline Trigger={"DOM"}> `DOM` <br/><br/>``Definition:`` Document Object Model</HoverCardInline> (There can be multiple DOMs/Documents inside a page).</><br/></>
        <br/>
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>

    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    ##### **!DOCTYPE**
        <>
        HTML Documents start by defining the Document type using the `<!DOCTYPE>{:html}` tag, followed by the type. 
        <span className="text-muted-foreground">_Example:_</span> 
            ```html title="newDocument.html"
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            ```
        </>
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>

## Making a Page [#creating-html-file]

### Steps:

<DocComponents.Steps.Steps>

    <DocComponents.Steps.Step> 
        
    #### Create the file: 
    
    <>Make sure to add the file extension `.html` at the end of the filename.</>
        
       
       <><DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="info">It's common and **recommended** practice to follow the `camelCase` naming scheme. <br/> <span className="text-muted-foreground">Example Below:</span></DocComponents.Callout.Callout></>
       
       ```js
        MyFile.html /* PascalCase */ // [!code --]
        myFile.html /* camelCase */ // [!code ++]
       ```
        <DocComponents.Files.Files>
            <DocComponents.Files.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
                <DocComponents.Files.File name="myFile.html" lang="html" icon={<IoLogoHtml5/>}>index.html</DocComponents.Files.File>
            </DocComponents.Files.Folder>
        </DocComponents.Files.Files>
        
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>

    <DocComponents.Steps.Step> 
    #### Define the Document
    Use the !DOCTYPE tag to define the document as an HTML document.
    ```html title="myFile.html"
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>

    <DocComponents.Steps.Step> 
    #### Add Document Structure
    There are *three* other HTML tags which are part of a HTML file's structure, they are:
        - `<html>{:html}`: This is a container element, that contains the document's HTML
        - `<head>{:html}`: This is a non-visible part of the page which is used to call scripts, include stylesheets, meta tags, and more.
        - `<body>{:html}`: This is where all of the UI, and visible parts of your page go.
    <DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="warn">It's highly recommended you do not include scripts `<script>{:html}` inside the `<body>{:html}`, instead place them in the `<head>{:html}` or inbetween `<head>{:html}` and `<body>{:html}` </DocComponents.Callout.Callout>
    ```html title="myFile.html"
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
    ```

    Now you have a complete HTML structure. The next step is creating our page!
