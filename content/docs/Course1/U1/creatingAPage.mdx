## The Checklist:

For most things in programming, it's far better to have a plan before you just start writing code.
This not only, helps you organize your thoughts, but also helps you to get a general idea of what technologies you're probably going to use. Furthermore, I've found that having a plan before I start something helps stop me from getting side tracked. Side tracking isn't a bad thing, as long as it teaches you something; however too much side tracking can end up demotivating you or it ends up creating a more stressful situation for yourself.

So lets come up with a basic plan of what our website needs, then we can go into details. 
For this, I'll start with a beginner site, that will be unstyled, since we haven't learned CSS yet.
<>
<DocComponents.Steps.Steps>
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        #### Title
        First, we need a title for our page! I'm going to keep things basic, and call my page: `My Page`
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        #### Purpose
        Next, we should probably know what our site is for. Since I don't want to type much, I'm going to center my page on: `My Interests`
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        #### Features
        In every site, you want features that are going to make it either stand out, or function. This could be anything from a topbar to a login page, to a full on dashboard.
        But I'm keeping this basic for now. so the features we'll have are:
        - `A Header`
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
        - `A footer`
    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        #### Technologies
       Websites often require multiple different tools, programming languages, and technologies to make. (A technology is pretty much like a tool or ultility that is used in development that isn't native to a programming language)

       For now, in order to make this site we'll just be using:
       - `HTML` &nbsp;<span className="attemptSameLine self-center"> <IoLogoHtml5/> </span> for the UI.
       <br/>&nbsp;&
       - `CSS` &nbsp;<span className="attemptSameLine self-center"> <IoLogoCss3/> </span> for the styling.

    </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
    <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        #### Layout
      Last, but not least. The layout, how do we want our page to look, and where should the main components of our site be?
      Well, I know we'll have a header, and footer, but lets go into more detail:<br/>
      My site is about my interests, so each interest should probably have its own space. And I think that i'll include a title/sub-heading, a paragraph, and image for each interest. 
      Now that we know what the main content will look like, we need to make a decision, how should we lay it out? Should the interests be stacked vertically, horizontally, random? I'm going to choose vertically. Since that'll give me the most room for each interest.

      So here's what that may look like: (Please excuse my lazy mspaint skills)
    <Image src={InterestsPageDesign.src} width={1500} height={1500} alt='page design'></Image>

</DocComponents.Steps.Step>

    ## The Page

    **So**, now lets go through those steps, creating the page. First though let me define any new elements that I'm using.
    <>


    ### New Elements
    | Element Name | Description | Where | Main Properties |
    | ------------ | ----------- | ----- | ------------- |
    | <div id="titleElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<title>{:html}`</div> | Sets the title of the page, and is visible on the tab      | Put in `<head>{:html}` | <>`innerText`</> |
    | <div id="headerElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<header>{:html}`</div> | A header, where naviagational links usually are, can also be a static header without naviagion. | Put in `<body>{:html}` | <>`innerText`</>
    | <div id="strongElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<strong>{:html}`</div> | A HTML element that bolds text. | Put in `<body>{:html}` | <>`innerText`</>
    | <div id="divElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<div>{:html}`</div> | A HTML element that acts as a container that holds and groups other elements. | Put in `<body>{:html}` | <>`children`</>
    | <div id="hElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>{:html}`</div> | A heading element, smaller the number typically = larger, more bold, text | Put in `<body>{:html}` | <>`innerText`</>
    | <div id="footerElement" className="justify-self-center border-none rounded-sm ">`<footer>{:html}`</div> | A footer, that resides at the bottom of a container, containing misc information. | Put in `<body>{:html}` | <>`innerText`</>
    
    <Link href={"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp"}>Learn More</Link>
    </>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <> <DocComponents.Steps.Steps>
        <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
            #### Title
            To set the tile of an HTML page, you use the: <ScrollToLink id={"titleElement"} >`<title>{:html}`</ScrollToLink> element.

            Now I'm going to create my title element:
            ```html
            <title>My Page</title>
            ```

            So my HTML file will now look like this. [Remember to follow those steps](./1#creating-html-file)
            ```html title="myHtmlPage.html"
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head>
                    <title>My Page</title>
                </head>

                <body></body>
            </html>
            ```
        </DocComponents.Steps.Step>
        <DocComponents.Steps.Step>
            #### Layout

            Just to help you out. Here are a list of new HTML elements I'll be using:
            - <ScrollToLink id={"titleElement"} >`<title>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>
            - <ScrollToLink id={"headerElement"} >`<header>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>
            - <ScrollToLink id={"strongElement"} >`<strong>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>
            - <ScrollToLink id={"divElement"} >`<div>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>
            - <ScrollToLink id={"hElement"} >`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>
            - <ScrollToLink id={"footerElement"} >`<footer>{:html}`</ScrollToLink>

            <><DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="error">**Attention!** Mobile users, it's strongly recommended to view this page on a larger screen, output pages on this page are not responsive for devices with smaller screen widths. **If you do wish to use mobile, it is recommended to have your screen orientation on: `Landscape`**</DocComponents.Callout.Callout></>

            So, we've established that our layout is going to be like this sketch:
            <Image src={InterestsPageDesign.src} width={1500} height={1500} alt='page design'></Image>

            So how would we start.

            Well, I like to start with headers, and footers, because they help you to organize the page and also help you better understand how the site is going to come out.
            So lets start with the header first. We'll write our header like this.
            
            <DocComponents.Callout.Callout>I'm using `style="..."{:ts}` just to show + position the actual element, because without styling, which we have not learned yet, you can't see anything but text. Formatting for this doesn't matter.</DocComponents.Callout.Callout>
            ```html
            <header style="
                padding: 0.5%;
                outline: solid;
                height: 15%;
                width: 100vw;"><h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1></header>
            ```
            Next we'll do the footer, and I'll also be adding  styling (`style="...":{:ts}`), but don't worry about knowing what that is currently. You'll learn it later, when we do styling (CSS).
            ```html
            <footer style="
                outline: solid;
                position: absolute;
                bottom: 0px;
                height: 10%;
                left: 0px;
                width: 100vw;">Made by: <strong>Me!</strong></footer>

            ```

        This will be the end result: (Yes I know it's ugly, we will change that in the next unit when we do CSS!)
          <HTML optionNum={1} />

        Now lets do the main content. I'm going to make one for now.

        We know we need these elements for each interest:
            - Heading
            - Text
            - and an Image
        
        We are going to organize this *(no this is not optional)*, because we'll have to style it. So we're going to use a `<div>{:html}` element, which acts as a container for the: Heading, Text, and Image.

        So lets start with the heading:

        We're also going to add an `id` property to the div, to help us later identify it.
        Our heading, doesn't need to be huge, so I'll use an `<h3>{:html}` element, which is smaller than these elements: `<h1>{:html}` `<h2>{:html}`
        
        
        <><DocComponents.Callout.Callout type="warn">**Make sure!** that you put this underneath header, and before footer.</DocComponents.Callout.Callout></>
        
        ```html
        <div id="interests-container" style="padding: 2%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px">
                    <div id="interest-1" style='display: grid; padding: 2%; outline: solid; gap: 5%; grid-template-areas: 
                    "heading heading img"
                    "text text img"
                    "text text img"
                    '>
                       
                        <div style="grid-area: heading; outline: solid; align-self: start; line-height: 0px; text-align: center;">
                            <h3>Ice Hockey!</h3>
                        </div>
        
                        <div style="grid-area: text; outline: solid;">
                            <p>I'm really into Ice-Hockey, since I was born in Minnesota (the state of hockey). My favourite teams are the Minnesota Wild, and the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
                        </div>
        
                        <div style="grid-area: img; outline: solid;">
                            <img alt="Image about hockey!" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" src="${MinnWildImage.src}"></img>
                        </div>
        
                    </div>
            </div>
        ```

        Here's how that'll look:
            <HTML optionNum={2} />
        
        So I'm going to add on more interest (you can add more, it's just the scaling of this output will probably only fit 2).
        And I'll go ahead and fill them out.

        Here's my completed div for the interests:
        ```html
        <div id="interests-container" style="padding: 2%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px">
            <div id="interest-1" style='display: grid; padding: 2%; outline: solid; gap: 5%; grid-template-areas: 
                    "heading heading img"
                    "text text img"
                    "text text img"
                    '>
                       
                <div style="grid-area: heading; outline: solid; align-self: start; line-height: 0px; text-align: center;">
                    <h3>Ice Hockey!</h3>
                </div>
            
                <div style="grid-area: text; outline: solid;">
                    <p>I'm really into Ice-Hockey, since I was born in Minnesota (the state of hockey). My favourite teams are the Minnesota Wild, and the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="grid-area: img; outline: solid;">
                    <img alt="Image about hockey!" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" src="/pathToImage"></img>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="interest-2" style='display: grid; padding: 2%; outline: solid; gap: 5%; grid-template-areas: 
                    "img heading heading "
                    "img text text"
                    "img text text"
                    '>
                       
                <div style="grid-area: heading; outline: solid; align-self: start; line-height: 0px; text-align: center;">
                    <h3>Technology</h3>
                </div>
        
                <div style="grid-area: text; outline: solid;">
                    <p>I like pretty much anything tech. I enjoy repairing, and assembling hardware, notably, laptops. I'm really passionate about programming and, I work on the Audio/Video team for my Church and I love seeing new things in technology.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div style="grid-area: img; outline: solid; width: 80%;">
                    <img alt="Image about Technology!" style="max-height: 160px ; width: 100%;" src="/pathToImage"></img>
                </div>
        
            </div>
        </div>
        ```
            <HTML optionNum={3} />

       

       So here's the completed HTML Page, incase you're lost:
       (Once again, the styling we have not gone over yet, we will do that next unit.)
        ```html title="myHtmlPage.html"
        <!DOCTYPE html>

## What Next?

Obviously we're not done. But were going to need to know how to style pages. So that's the next thing!
